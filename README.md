# R Programming with dplyr
## üöÄ Beginner's Guide to dplyr

Welcome to the **dplyr** learning project! This repository is designed for beginners who want to dive into data manipulation using R's powerful **dplyr** package. Whether you're analyzing data for a project or just exploring datasets, dplyr provides a set of intuitive functions to make your life easier.

## üåü Why Use dplyr?

- **Simplicity**: dplyr uses a straightforward syntax that makes data manipulation tasks easy to understand and implement.
  
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance, dplyr can handle large datasets with ease.

- **Versatility**: Works seamlessly with various data sources, including data frames, databases, and more.

- **Chaining**: The ability to chain commands together using the pipe operator (`%>%`) allows for cleaner and more readable code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Problems for Beginners

Here are some basic problems to help you get started with dplyr:

1. **Filtering Rows**:  
   Use `filter()` to select rows based on specific conditions.  
   **Example**: Select all rows where `age` is greater than 30.

2. **Selecting Columns**:  
   Use `select()` to choose specific columns from your dataset.  
   **Example**: Select only the `name` and `salary` columns.

3. **Mutating Data**:  
   Use `mutate()` to create new variables or modify existing ones.  
   **Example**: Create a new column `salary_after_tax` by applying a tax rate to the `salary` column.

4. **Summarizing Data**:  
   Use `summarize()` to compute summary statistics.  
   **Example**: Calculate the average `salary` by `department`.

5. **Grouping Data**:  
   Use `group_by()` to group your data for further analysis.  
   **Example**: Group data by `department` and then summarize the average `salary`.
